# Brain Tumor MRI Classification

## Description

This project is designed to classify MRI images of brain tumors using deep learning techniques. The model uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) to classify images into four categories: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can also set up a virtual environment for this project.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/brain-tumor-classification.git
   cd brain-tumor-classification
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Brain_Tumor_Classification.ipynb
```

Follow the instructions in the notebook to train and evaluate the model.
